# AI Coding Workflow 
*A beginner-friendly guide, with minimal setup to start coding with AI assistance*

> **What is "vibe coding"?**  
> *Vibe coding is a hilarious slang for using generative AI for software projects "This programmer is making software with nothing but vibes!". While there are lots of criticism about this approach, from an engineering perspective it has solved a significant bottleneck of software development - the learning curve.*
>
> *For myself, a practical and measured take on vibe coding is to treat it as if learning from a patient and kind software expert, applying what you learn, and solving real world problems all-in-one all in real-time.*
>
> *Code is a means to an end, real engineering comes from learning and applying - these fundamentals are timeless and would apply with or without generative AI. This tutorial is less about generative AI, and much more about setting up a learning workflow.*

This tutorial walks you through the full beginner workflow using tools like **VS Code**, **Qwen Code**, **Python**, **npm**, and **Git**. You'll go from zero to sharing your first AI-assisted project on GitHub!

## ✅ Step 1: Download and Install the Tools

### 1. Install **VS Code** (or any IDE)
- Go to [VS Code Homepage](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Download for your OS (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Run the installer (keep defaults)
- Start VS Code (this is our core tool)

<img width="742" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15083683-5a6d-449b-9786-3df1c1472e86" />


### 2. Install **Python**
- Go to [Python Homepage](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download the latest version
- ✅ **Important**: Check “Add Python to PATH” during install!
- Python is a intepreter for the coding language, we dont have to "start a program"

<img width="950" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a96290e7-58a1-4f70-9cd4-705eac5dc656" />


### 3. Install **Node.js** (includes **npm**)
- Go to [Node.js Homepage](https://nodejs.org/)
- Download the **LTS** version (recommended for beginners)
- Run the installer
- Node.js is a runtime environment, and JIT compiler, we also do not technically run any exe file.

<img width="1142" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83f2b96f-d1e4-4648-b8df-a8842ff9325d" />


> After installing, open VSC Terminal (Bash) and type the following:
> ```bash
> python --version
> npm --version
> git --version
> ```
> If these return version numbers, you’re good!

### 4 (Optional). Get **Qwen Code**
- Option A: Use Qwen via web at [Qwen Chat](chat.qwen.ai)
  - You can copy-paste code between browser and VS Code
- Option B: Use **Qwen Code** (official Qwen Code extension)
  - Visit the official Qwen Code github repo for more details https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code

## 📁 Step 1a: Set Up Your Working Folder

1. Open **File Explorer** ([Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/file-explorer-in-windows-ef370130-1cca-9dc5-e0df-2f7416fe1cb1)) or **Finder** ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/mac-help/mchlp2605/mac))
2. Go to your **Documents** folder
3. Create a new folder called `my-first-ai-project`
4. In VS Code: `File → Open Folder` → Select this folder

<img width="539" height="496" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d303df3b-5ea9-45dc-9ed9-9e5d2897dee2" />


You now have a clean workspace! Everything you build will live here.

---

## 👀 Step 1b (Optional): Get Comfortable with VS Code & Qwen Code

### In VS Code:
- **Explorer** (left sidebar): Your files and folders
- **Editor** (center): Where you write code
- **Terminal** (bottom): Type commands like `python your_script.py`
  - Open it with `Ctrl + `` ` (backtick) or `View → Terminal`

<img width="744" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d959832-2588-4a33-bc9a-414927eb3afa" />

### Using Qwen Code (via https://chat.qwen.ai/):
1. Prepare your prompt or problem you have faced (90% of the work)
2. Copy and paste it into the chatbot
3. Read the response and follow the steps

---

## 🎯 Step 2: Plan Your Project (“Architecting & Engineering”)

Before writing code, ask yourself:

### 🔍 What are you trying to build?
- Prepare a strong starting prompt giving the AI as much details as you can
- Example: *“Make a batch emailer script that when run will send emails to my list of clients.”*
> - Or try one of these sample projects:
>   - **[Batch Emailer](./batch_emailer/README.md)** - STATUS: Compelted
>   - **[Interactive Resume Page](./interactive_resume/README.md)** - STATUS: Completed [External Repo](https://github.com/kendricksin/interactive_resume)
>   - **[POS Data Analyzer](./pos_data_analyzer/README.md)** - STATUS: TBC

### ✅ What does “done” look like? (Define success)
- It runs without errors
- It reads my input files and sends emails with my selected template
- I can send it to any email including my friends email

### ⚙️ What technologies will you use?
- Language: **Python** (simple and readable)
- No external libraries needed (keep it beginner-friendly)
- Git for version control

> 💡 **AI Tip**: Treat Qwen like a senior dev teammate—be clear, specific, and polite!

> 🧠 **Learning**: Ask AI what are the technologies availabe to choose and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.

### 📚 Sample Projects to Try
Check out the [Sample Projects](#-sample-projects) section above for hands-on tutorials you can build using this workflow!

---

## 🔄 Step 3: The “Prompt → Test → Commit” Cycle

This is your core workflow. Repeat as needed!

### 1. **Prompt** (Ask Qwen for help)
- Example prompt:  
  *“Write a python scripts that uses SMTP to send my email template to my friends email using my email.”*
- Paste Qwen’s response into a new file in VS Code: `email_script.py`

### 2. **Test** (Run and check)
- In VS Code Terminal:
  ```bash
  python email_script.py
  ```
- Try it! Does it work? If not:
  - Read the error
  - Copy it into Qwen: *“Why am I getting this error: …?”*

### 3. **Commit** (Save your progress with Git)
Every time you finish a small working version:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "I added a new button"
```

> ✅ Each commit is a safe checkpoint. You can always go back!
> 🧠 **Learning**: Ask any AI Chatbot what Git is and "how to use Git like a pro"!

## 🧘 Final Tips for Vibe Coding Success

- **Break it into smaller pieces**: Break the problem up into smaller problems and test each one
- **Embrace errors**: They’re clues, not failures - solving the errors is where work gets done
- **Ask AI to explain and offer solutions** While AI gives great answers, only the creator can make good engineering decisions
- **Commit often**: “It works!” → commit. “Added color” → commit.
- **Have fun**: Coding + AI = creative superpower
